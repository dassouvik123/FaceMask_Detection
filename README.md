# Face Mask Detection for covid-19 using deep learning.
As Covid-19 is spreading at a rage ,to stop it the World Health Organization(WHO) has given out two primary suggestions to prevent it from spreading which mostly takes place via physical contact or through respiratory droplets.For physical contact they have proposed to maintain a distance of 6 ft from another person, and to stop droplets they have proposed to wear a mask whenever in public.So for everyone's safety all of us should abide by the rules but for who are flouting them we have presented a mask detection system to catch hold of the people who are breaking the rules and putting all of us at a great danger.We will be using deep learning algorithm to detect images and say weather the person is wearing a mask or not.
